the moment we decided everything needed to be frictionless and intuitive, we traded away the natural learning process that builds actual security awareness. when you have to manually configure your network settings or compile your own tools, you inevitably learn what's actually happening - which ports are open, what data is being sent where, how authentication really works. but now people install apps without reading permissions, use cloud services without understanding the data flow, and trust gui tools they can't audit.

<br>

the complexity didn't disappear, it just got hidden behind interfaces that make it impossible to see what's really going on, and conveniently, those same interfaces make it trivial for companies to harvest your data without you realizing it. every layer of convenience is another layer where something can go wrong without you knowing it, or where someone else can profit from your digital exhaust.

<br>

the people with the best operational security are usually the ones who learned on systems that forced them to understand the fundamentals, because you can't accidentally expose what you consciously configured. modern computing has optimized for the wrong thing - instead of teaching users to be competent, we've taught them to be dependent on systems they can't inspect or control, systems specifically designed to extract value from their ignorance.

fortunately, this makes my job much easier :)
